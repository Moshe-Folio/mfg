# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
- Next.js 15 application
- React components with TypeScript
- Supabase backend integration
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Radix UI for accessible components

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Next.js for server-side rendering and routing
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. Supabase for backend services
4. TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
5. Radix UI for accessible components
6. React Hook Form for form management
7. Zod for schema validation

## Design Patterns
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Context API for state management
- Form validation patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Authentication patterns

## Component Relationships
- Page components
- Layout components
- UI components
- Form components
- Authentication components
- Data fetching components

## State Management
- React Context for global state
- Local state with useState
- Form state with react-hook-form
- Server state with Supabase

## Data Flow
- Client-side data fetching
- Server-side data fetching
- Real-time updates
- Form submissions
- Error handling
